There’s something about Queen’s song "I Want to Break Free" that hits deep, doesn’t it? It’s not just a catchy tune—it’s an anthem. An anthem for anyone who’s ever felt trapped by expectations, routine, or the roles they’re supposed to play.

But let me ask you: Do you want to break free? More importantly, CAN you?

In a world filled with rules, norms, and traditions, we often feel the pressure to follow paths that were laid out long before us. Study hard. Get a stable job. Settle down. Live by the script. But what if that’s not what you want? What if there’s more? 


Have you ever stopped and asked yourself, “Am I living for me, or for everyone else?”

We’re surrounded by so many questions:  

- What do you really want in life?  

- Are you free to follow that path?  

- What’s holding you back from making the choices you truly desire?  

- Can you break away from societal expectations and carve your own path?

The Queen sang about wanting to break free, and we feel that same pull every day. But here’s the thing—are you really free to answer those questions honestly? And if you are, are you free to act on them?

Breaking Free—In More Ways Than One

When we started Bestia Brisk, we didn’t want to create just another coffee brand. We wanted to break free from the ordinary. We wanted something that wasn’t just good enough, but something that really meant something—coffee that fuels your purpose, not just your morning routine.

Like life, coffee should be more than just another box to tick off. But the big question is: are you free to enjoy that, to make those choices that resonate with you, instead of just settling for what’s easy?

What Does Freedom Really Look Like?

Freedom isn’t just about escaping from something. It’s about stepping into something new—something that reflects who YOU are. Just like our coffee, it’s about the choice to experience something deeper, richer, more meaningful. But the tough part? You have to ask yourself whether you have the courage to take that step.

Are you living the life you truly want, or just ticking off the boxes that someone else created for you? Have you ever dared to say, “No, this isn’t enough—I want more”?

Ask Yourself Honestly

So here’s where it gets real. If you want to break free, what’s stopping you? What’s holding you back from making that leap? Maybe it’s fear, maybe it’s expectations, or maybe you’ve never even allowed yourself to think about it before. But ask yourself now:

  
- What do you want?

- Are you free?


I’ll poke myself with the same questions in the time being.
