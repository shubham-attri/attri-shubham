  Let me ask you something: how often do you find yourself doing things because it’s what’s expected? Following the same path, making the same choices, all because it feels like that’s what you’re supposed to do? I’ve been there too. 

  

Recently, I was rereading The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, one of the early books that got me into reading, and it hit me how much that story reflects not only my personal journey but the story of Bestia Brisk. In the book, Santiago, the main character, leaves behind a comfortable life to chase his dream, a dream that many told him was impractical. But through all the ups and downs, he stays true to himself. And in doing so, he finds a deeper sense of purpose, and ultimately, the treasure he was searching for.

  

That hit home for me. For me, Bestia Brisk wasn’t born out of some grand business plan or foolproof strategy.I was tired of settling for less—whether it was in life, or in something as seemingly simple as coffee. I didn’t want a mediocre experience, and I definitely didn’t want to serve one.

  

Something Real

So, why authenticity? Why does it matter so much to me—and why am I bringing it up now? Because I believe that in a world that often pressures us to conform, being authentic is one of the bravest things we can do.

  

When we started Bestia Brisk, it wasn’t with the intention of just selling coffee. We wanted to do something different—something that felt real, both to us and to the people who would eventually drink it. And I’ll be honest with you, there were so many moments when taking shortcuts or compromising felt tempting. The journey to building something authentic isn’t easy, and I’ll never pretend that it is. 

  

But here’s the thing: staying true to your values, even when it’s hard, is always worth it in the end. For us, that meant finding the right beans in Coorg, even when it took longer than expected. It meant roasting in small batches, even when scaling up would have been the easier choice.

  

Just Business?

Now, I’m not just talking about coffee here. This goes way beyond that. It’s about how we approach life, too. I think that’s what authenticity really comes down to: believing in something so deeply that you’re willing to stick to it, even when the path gets tough. It’s about doing what feels right to you, not what’s easy, not what everyone else says you should be doing. And the truth is, every time I choose to be authentic, both in my personal life and in this business, I feel more connected to what I’m building.

  

The Journey We’re On

Look, I’m not here to preach. I know that living authentically isn’t always a smooth ride. It’s messy, and sometimes it feels like you’re going against the current. But I also know that it’s in those moments when we choose to stay true to ourselves that we grow the most.

  

We’re both on a journey, trying to live life on our own terms. Whether you’re chasing a dream, building something of your own, or simply trying to stay true to who you are—it’s all part of the same quest for authenticity. And just like Santiago in The Alchemist, we might stumble, we might doubt, but in the end, we’ll find our treasure.

  

And just like the journey Santiago goes on, this journey isn’t one we’re taking alone. We’re building this with you, for people like us—those who are bold enough to stay true to themselves, to chase their own dreams, and to live authentically and unapologetically.
