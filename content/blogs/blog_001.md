# My Journey into AI and Deep Tech

_March 19, 2024_

As someone deeply passionate about technology, I've always been fascinated by how systems work at their core. In this post, I want to share my journey into AI and deep tech, and how I approach learning complex systems.

## The Beginning

It all started with a simple question: How do machines learn? This led me down a rabbit hole of neural networks, deep learning, and the fascinating world of artificial intelligence.

## Current Focus

I'm currently working on Agent Binod, a legal assistant that can research, analyze, and draft documents. The project combines several interesting aspects of AI:

- Large Language Models for understanding and generating text
- Agents for autonomous decision making
- Information retrieval and processing

## What's Next

The field of AI is moving incredibly fast, and I'm excited to continue learning and building. Some areas I'm particularly interested in:

1. Reinforcement Learning for post-training optimization
2. Multi-modal AI systems
3. Efficient inference and deployment

Stay tuned for more updates on my projects and learnings!
