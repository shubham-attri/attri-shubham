# About Me

Hey! I'm Shubham, 22, and I'm deeply passionate about deep tech. I spend hours breaking down complex systems to understand their core mechanisms. While others spend time on entertainment, I find myself immersed in research papers and technical documentation.

Feynman's approach to breaking down complex concepts into fundamental principles has greatly influenced my thinking. I firmly believe in the power of reverse engineering - if something exists, it can be understood.
