Hi, I am Shubham Attri, a tech optimist and a student for life. <br>
I am passionate about building and always in a awe what the sharpest of the minds are solving for. I am bullish on India and the opportunities it has to offer for young folks like me. <br>
I've been building in consumer space with [bestiabrisk](www.bestiabrisk.com), and I am loving every bit of it.<br>
<br>
I try to write sometimes, do check it out below:
