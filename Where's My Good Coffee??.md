Every brand has a beginning, and ours started with a simple question: Why settle for less? My name is Shubham, and I’m one of the co-founders of Bestia Brisk. 

Let me take you through the story of how Bestia Brisk came to life and why we’re doing what we’re doing.

A Seed of Inspiration

The idea for Bestia Brisk didn’t come out of a grand master plan—it came from a real frustration that many coffee lovers can relate to. We were tired of instant coffee that lacked depth, flavour, and that special something. At first, we didn’t know what the solution would look like, but we knew one thing: we weren’t going to settle for ‘good enough.’

  

Starting this journey wasn’t easy. We knew nothing about the complexities of sourcing premium beans or the intricacies of roasting. But we were driven by one goal—to create instant coffee that didn’t feel like a compromise. We took that challenge head-on, learning everything we could, and slowly the vision for Bestia Brisk began to take shape.


The Heart of Our Coffee: Coorg

One of the most important decisions we made early on was where to source our beans. We knew we couldn’t cut corners if we wanted to create something truly special. After a lot of research (and a fair bit of trial and error), we found Coorg, a region in India that’s famous for its rich coffee plantations.

  

We fell in love with the place—its beauty, its people, and the dedication of the farmers. Coorg wasn’t just a location; it became part of our story. The AAA-grade beans we source from single farms in this region are the backbone of Bestia Brisk. And honestly, they’re the reason we feel so confident in our coffee.

  

Small Batches, Big Impact:

We’ll admit—working with small batches is harder. It requires more time, more attention, and more effort. But for us, it’s worth it. We roast each batch of coffee slowly and carefully, making sure that every bean reaches its full potential. We don’t rush it. We’ve made mistakes along the way—there were moments when we thought we wouldn’t get it right—but each challenge taught us something new.

  

The truth is, crafting great coffee takes patience. But we’re not in this to take shortcuts. We’re here to deliver an experience that’s as close to perfect as we can make it, one small batch at a time.

  

Elevating the Coffee Experience

Creating the right blend was one of the toughest parts of the process. It took months of experimentation to get the balance between Arabica and Robusta just right. And honestly, there were times we doubted whether we’d ever get it to match the vision we had in our heads. But we kept pushing.

  

The result? A blend that’s 60% Arabica for smoothness and 40% Robusta for strength. This combination doesn’t just taste great—it gives you a boost that lasts for hours. We designed it for people like us, who need their coffee to do more than just taste good. It’s functional, clean, and natural—no chicory, no preservatives, just pure coffee.

  

The Bestia Brisk Promise

The truth is, starting Bestia Brisk hasn’t been easy. There were moments when we questioned ourselves, moments when we wondered if it was worth it. But every time we sip that final product, we’re reminded of why we started this journey in the first place. 

  

We’re not here to just sell coffee—we’re here to offer something special. Something that feels different, tastes different, and is made with the kind of care that you can taste in every cup. And that’s a promise we’re proud to stand by.

  

Bestia Brisk was born out of a desire to change the way people think about instant coffee. We wanted to create something that didn’t just meet expectations but exceeded them. And while the road has been tough, it’s also been incredibly rewarding.

  

We’re still learning, still growing, but one thing remains constant—our commitment to bringing you the 

finest coffee possible. So here’s to the journey so far, and to the road ahead. We’re glad you’re with us.
